# Titanic-Challenge
The project was one of my entries to the kaggle titanic challenge
In this project I used 3 different classifiers to predict which of the titanic passengers would have been most likely to survive given their age, sex, coach class etc. 
I used machine learning libraries of Scikit learn, data visualisation libraries of seaborn and matplotlib to perform my analysis. 
Random Forest Classifier had the best performance score for my data set from other classifiers of XGBoost Classifier,  VotingClassifier and Support Vector Classifier
